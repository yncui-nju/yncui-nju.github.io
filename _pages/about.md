# About Me
I am currently a 4th-year Ph.D. Student at [Websoft Research Group](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Websoft) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, 
Nanjing University, advised by [Prof. Wei Hu](http://ws.nju.edu.cn/~whu).

My research interests primarily covers a range of issues: Graph Foundation Model, Knowledge graph, Lifelong Learning & LLMs.
